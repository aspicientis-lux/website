            <h1>An Endeavor into photography</h1>
            <p>
                When I first picked up a camera, I found it a bit tedious. Looking through a
                small viewfinder, pressing a button, and then ending up with blurry and meaningless
                pictures was not very exciting. However, my perspective changed when I saw a
                good friend playing with his camera. He explained to me that photography
                is not just about the camera, but about experiencing the world. It took me
                years to fully understand what he meant.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a computer scientist and engineer, I tend to focus on technology all
                the time. Although photography can be technical, it is so much more than
                that. It is about capturing the overwhelming feeling of standing on a
                mountain and looking out at an incredible scene, or trying to communicate
                the stunning beauty of a bird looking straight into my lens. So, an image
                doesn’t always have to be technically perfect. On these pages,
                you’ll find some of my endeavors in photography and
                the world.
