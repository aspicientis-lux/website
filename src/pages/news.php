            <h2>Beavers</h2>
            <p>
                De Biesbosch is the largest freshwater area in Europe that is influenced
                by tides, making it difficult for the rivers in the region to drain
                water to the sea during high tides. The area is home to many beavers,
                but spotting them requires a boat despite being I life close by.
                The beavers are most active around sunset, and I finally had the
                chance to see them yesterday.

            <h2>Costa Rica</h2>
            <p>
                When an opportunity arises to travel, I wouldnâ€™t say no. But when the
                destination is an incredible country for birding and wildlife enthusiasts,
                my heart skipped a beat.

                The biodiversity of the country is phenomenal. Because of the geography,
                you travel for an hour and you may end up in a completely different
                eco-system.

            <h2>Black & white</h2>
            <p>
                Today, I decided to experiment with black-and-white photography. I revisited
                a series of colorful photos I took in Antwerp a few months ago and started
                playing with black and white. I explored every shade of gray in between to
                create a unique and captivating effect.
