            <h2>Costa Rica</h2>
            <p>
                When an opportunity arises to travel, I wouldnâ€™t say no. But when the
                destination is an incredible country for birding and wildlife enthusiasts,
                my heart skipped a beat.
            </p>

                The biodiversity of the country is phenomenal. Because of the geography,
                you travel for an hour and you may end up in a completely different
                eco-system.

            <h2>Black & white</h2>
            <p>
                Today, I decided to experiment with black-and-white photography. I revisited
                a series of colorful photos I took in Antwerp a few months ago and started
                playing with black and white. I explored every shade of gray in between to
                create a unique and captivating effect.
