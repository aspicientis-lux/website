            <p>
                Like the greylag goose, the feral pigeon is a bird that usually
                goes unnoticed. But this bird in Jerusalem caught my eye with its
                furious glare, as a common buzzard (Buteo Buteo) had just flown away.
                I had to take his portrait.
