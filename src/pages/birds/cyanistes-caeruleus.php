                Watching Blue Tits is a lot of fun. They have a charming appearance,
                with a blue cap and a white face with a black stripe around the eyes.
                They look so adorable that you might wish to hug them. They are also
                very agile and can perform amazing feats of flight and climbing.
            <p>
                You'll often see Blue tits perched on branches, hanging upside down,
                or performing acrobatic maneuvers.

            <h2>Seeds</h2>
            <p>
                    They like to feed on insects when they are breeding, but they
                    will also use their beaks to snatch seeds or other plant matter.
            <p>
            <p>
                You will find them everywhere, in the forest, in parks and even
                in gardens, but there are fast and not as easy to catch in a photo
                as you may assume.
