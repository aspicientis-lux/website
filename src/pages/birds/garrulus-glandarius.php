            <h1>Garrulus Glandarius</h1>
            <p>
                This bird is also called the “Shouting Magpie” in Dutch. It lives up to its name!
                It has a very unique song. It belongs to the Corvidae (Crows) family and is
                very smart. It can store food for later use. Studies have shown that
                it has one of the highest brain to body ratios of all animals! The
                Garrulus Glandarius species has many subspecies, and this one is a
                Garrulus Glandarius Atricapillus. That’s why its colors are not as bright as some others.
            </p>
            <p>However, recently we had a specimen visiting our garden which cave me the perfect opportunity to take a couple of shot of its much brigther Dutch brother.</p>
