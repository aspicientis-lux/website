                The Common Snipe is a rare sight in my country. since they are an endangered
                species in The Netherlands. I hope their homes will be protected
                by nature conservation. The bird blends in well with its surroundings
                and is difficult to see when it hides in the reeds. But when it
                feeds in the shallow water, you can admire its lovely appearance.
