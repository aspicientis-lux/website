            <h1>Podiceps Cristatus</h1>
            <p>
                I was passing the pond where a couple of grebes built their nest on regular base,
                since it was not far from my home. At the side of a highway entrance they had found a
                cozy spot hidden from the staring eyes of the general public. Once I saw that she
                laid her eggs, it was just a matter of time. So, after four weeks, I had the
                pleasure of observing how the chicks are having fun, riding along the parents
                back. Sometimes just one, sometimes all fives of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                But not only when they have chicks the beautiful grebes are always nice to see.
                Often when there is competition from other birds, they tend to get closer just to
                grab some of your attention.
