            <p>
                Within Bird and wild-life photography there is this rule: the action
                only happens when you put away your camera. This photo was no exception.
                After a long afternoon of hiking (my camera and lens weigh more than 3 kilos together)
                we reached the parking lot to get in the car. But a song thrush revealed
                itself by its singing – they have earned their name for a reason – and
                I got one more shot for ‘the catch of the day’.
