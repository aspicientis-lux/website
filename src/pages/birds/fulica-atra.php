            <h1>Fulica Atra</h1>
            <p>
                Donâ€™t let the size of this small water bird (Eurasian Coot) fool you, they are
                ferocious little creatures! They are fast, sometimes even aggressive, and
                afraid of nothing! In the past, I was working in an office with a pond
                in front of it. Always when the swans arrived all the other birds went
                away or hid themselves, but not this little guy, while the swans were
                20 times bigger than them, they still tried to scare them away!
