                When it comes to Great Tits, somehow I am not so ‘lucky’. They are
                one of the most common birds in the Netherlands, but every time I’m
                carrying my camera, they are between the leaves or the light is not
                what it should be for a great picture. So I was rather happy to see
                that I took at least one decent photo of a Great Tit during a nice
                hike in the south not so long ago.
