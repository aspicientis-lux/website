        <p>
            One of the biggest kinds of deer is the red deer, which lives in many places in Europe.
            They can adapt to different environments, but they like to stay near the forest borders.
            They might seem harmless, but they are very aggressive with their horns when they are
            looking for a mate, and sometimes they even kill their rivals.
