        <p>
            This semi-wild horse – the Konik – can be found in several nature reserve
            parks in the Netherlands. Its origin can be traced to Poland, where it also
            got its name, literally, ‘small horse’.

            They are helping to maintain an eco-system balance because they eat in the same
            place repeatedly thus keeping plains open from too many bushes and trees.
