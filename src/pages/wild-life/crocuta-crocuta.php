        <p>
            Hyaenas are usually seen as foolish scavenger and have a bad reputation.
            But if you know more about them or meet one, you will discover a very
            skilled hunter. They have a much stronger bite than a Lion and they
            can break bones with their jaws. This capability makes them an essential part of
            their eco-system because many animals rely for their calcium intakes on those bones!

            I took this photo in the wild, from 20 meters away. I was on a morning
            walk with a guard who had a gun, when this hyaena came out of the bushes.
            It kept looking at us as it crossed our path and then went back into the bushes.
