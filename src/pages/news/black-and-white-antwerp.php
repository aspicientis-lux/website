                Occasionally, when I encounter new people and collaborate with them for some time,
                they express surprise that I donâ€™t always have a definitive stance on things.
                Initially, they anticipated me to be a person who thinks in black and white.
                But then I explain: I tend to think in a more colorful and nuanced way than most people.

                But today, I decided to experiment with black-and-white photography.
                I revisited a series of colorful photos I took in Antwerp a few months ago
                and started playing with black and white. I explored every shade of gray
                in between to create a unique and captivating effect.
